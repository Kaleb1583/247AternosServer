i realized it seems sketch but i promise its not malicious in any way you can look at the js if you please, im just doing this for fun. (sorry if it seems unclear i tried to explain the best i could.)


Note: theres a chance it runs into a error or doesnt press the +1 min button and causes it to shut down its not flawless

Note: you should use a device that you dont regularly use and keep the aternos tab open (or on a second monitor) or it might stop the script like it did for me)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
full.js still needs improvement, baremin.js should be as good as it could get

full.js: allows you to go from offline to online with no inactivity shut down / this 247 script 
To Use: go to /server/ and run script (you may need to watch ad and only then its automatic)
DevTools Console Functions: you can use startServer(), stopServer(), restartServer()

baremin.js: this is the bare mininum script that just adds time if no players are online
To Use: go to /server/, turn the server on, run the script

aternosVars.js: if you want to add on or create something in js theres everything i could find when it comes to js functions and vars and also using classes to get values too

you can use the dev tools console (ctrl+shift+i) or dev tools snippets (which i used to make this) and maybe theres other ways
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if you dont want to do it through the website and instead client side you can use this:
