i realized it seems sketch but i promise its not malicious in any way you can look at the js if you please, im just doing this for fun. (sorry if it seems unclear i tried to explain the best i could.)

theres a chance it runs into a error or doesnt press the +1 min button and causes it to shut down fyi

(you should use a device that you dont regularly use and keep the aternos tab open (or on a second monitor) or it might stop the script like it did for me)

JS Script 1: allows you to go from offline to online with no inactivity shut down / this 247 script 
(go to /server/ and run script) (may need to watch ad and only then its automatic)

JS Script 2: this is the bare mininum script, you should run it after turning on the server

if you dont want to do it through the website you can use this: 

(i found these after making this but the pc i have laying around is slow & old and in turn constantly spitting errors)
