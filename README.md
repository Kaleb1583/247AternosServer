i realized it seems sketch but i promise its not malicious in any way you can look at the js if you please, im just doing this for fun. 

sorry if it seems unclear i tried to explain the best i could.

Note: theres a chance it runs into a error or doesnt press the +1 min button and causes it to shut down, its not flawless.

Note: you should use a device that you dont regularly use and keep the aternos tab open (or on a second monitor) or it might stop the script like it did for me)


AntiServerShutdown.js: this is the bare mininum script that just adds time if no players are online
To Use: go to /server/, turn the server on, run the script

vars.js: if you want to create a script that manipulates aternos' functions and buttons like this or add on to this you can use this to help ( functions, variables, buttons (through class names) )

you can use the dev tools console or dev tools snippets (CTRL + SHIFT + I (Chrome/Opera))

if you dont want to do it through the website and instead client side you can use this: SpreeHertz's repo: https://github.com/SpreeHertz/aternos-afk-abuser
