24/7 Aternos Server

instead of making a client sit in your aternos server like i thought abt and maybe you, i thought about just automating a button press in aternos.org/server/ which allows you to add an extra minute like if your game is loading slow you can add an extra min but there doesnt seem to be a limit so i made this script that just presses it every time it gets to 0:59 (+1 Minute button only shows up only after theres only a minute to join until it turns off)
