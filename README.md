I realize this might seem sketchy, but I promise it's not malicious in any way. You can review the JavaScript if you please. I'm just doing this for fun.

Sorry if some parts seem unclear, I tried to explain everything the best I could.

### Notes:
- **Possible Errors**: There's a chance it could run into an error or fail to press the "+1 min" button, which could cause the server to shut down. It's not flawless.
- **Device Use**: It's best to use this on a device you don't regularly use. Keep the Aternos tab open (on a second monitor, if possible) to avoid interruptions, as the script might stop like it did for me.

### Files
1. **AntiServerShutdown.js**  
   This is the bare minimum script that just adds time if no players are online.  
   **To Use**: Go to `/server/`, turn the server on, and run the script.

2. **vars.js**  
   If you want to create a script that manipulates Aternos' functions and buttons or build on top of this, you can use this as a helper.  
   It includes references to functions, variables, and buttons (through class names).

---

### How to Use:
- You can use the Dev Tools Console or Dev Tools Snippets.  
  Shortcut: `CTRL + SHIFT + I` (Chrome/Opera).

### Alternatives:
If you don't want to do this through the website and prefer a client-side approach, you can check out SpreeHertz's repo:
