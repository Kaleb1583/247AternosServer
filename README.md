#24/7 Aternos Server (through aternos website instead of in-game)

i realized it seems sketch but i promise its not malicious in any way you can look at the js if you please, im just doing this for fun. (sorry for so many words below)

theres a chance it runs into a error or doesnt press the +1 min button and causes it to shut down fyi

(you should use a device that you dont regularly use and keep the aternos tab open (or on a second monitor) or it might stop the script like it did for me)

JS Script 1: allows you to go from offline to online with no inactivity shut down / this 247 script 
(go to /server/ and run script) (may need to watch ad and only then its automatic)

JS Script 2: this is the bare mininum script, you should run it after turning on the server

instead of making a client sit in your aternos server like i thought abt and maybe you, i thought about just automating a button press in aternos.org/server/ which allows you to add an extra minute like if your game is loading slow you can add an extra min but there doesnt seem to be a limit so i made this script that just presses it every time it gets to 0:59 (+1 Minute button only shows up only after theres only a minute to join until it turns off)


if you dont want to do it through the website you can use this: 

(i found these after making this but the pc i have laying around is slow & old and in turn constantly spitting errors)
